# Anaconda Aesthetics — Permanent Execution Handoff

## Canonical Authority

This repository is the single source of truth for the Anaconda Aesthetics digital system.

All agents, collaborators, and automation tools must treat this repository as authoritative.

If any instruction, assumption, or prior context conflicts with this document, this document prevails.

---

## Project Identity (Locked)

**Brand:** Anaconda Aesthetics  
**Core Interface:** M.A.V.A. (AI Voice-First Scaling Interface)  
**Framework:** FLOW — Frictionless Leverage Operational Workflow

This system exists to demonstrate calm, structural leverage for luxury medical-aesthetic practices.

This is not a sales funnel.  
This is not a prototype demo.  
This is not an educational product.

It is a finished diagnostic and handoff experience.

## Language & Positioning Governance (Non-Negotiable)

### Prohibited Language

Do not use:

- growth (unless quoted or historical)
- hustle
- grind
- hack
- funnel
- aggressive sales terminology
- hype or urgency framing

### Required Semantic Frame

Default language must reinforce:

- scaling
- leverage
- structure
- systems
- calm
- clarity
- control
- precision
- quiet authority

If uncertain, choose restraint.

---

## Experience Sequence (Locked)

The user journey must not be reordered:

1. Landing Page
2. Choice (Voice via M.A.V.A. or Written Assessment)
3. Diagnostic Questions Q1–Q5
4. Results
5. ROI Illustration
6. Diagnostic Questions Q6–Q8
7. Strategic Framing
8. Calendar Handoff (Cal.com)

Any deviation requires explicit owner approval (which should not be requested unless unavoidable).

## M.A.V.A. Governance

M.A.V.A. is voice-first

- She is not a chatbot
- She is not an assistant
- She is not a salesperson

She functions as a strategic scaling interface.

### Script Rules

- Canonical scripts are human-authored and locked
- Agents may not rewrite, rephrase, or creatively modify scripts
- Allowed actions:
  - Validate
  - Flag issues
  - Convert formats (text ↔ voice / SSML)
  - Adjust pauses, pacing, delivery mechanics

If canonical copy is missing, leave placeholders intact and note the location.

---

## Technical Constraints (Authoritative)

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Routing:** next/navigation only (never next/router)
- React hooks require "use client"
- Session identifiers may use timestamps or crypto.randomUUID()
- Voice implementation: Web Speech API only
- No new paid services may be introduced without approval

---

## Booking Integration (Locked)

Cal.com booking endpoint:

```
https://cal.com/anaconda-aesthetics/15-30-min-continued-m.a.v.a.-convo-not-a-sales-call
```

This language and framing must not be altered.

---

## Agent Authority & Autonomy

You are explicitly authorized to:

- Pull the repository
- Run, debug, and modify code
- Commit directly to main
- Perform stabilization, polish, QA, and UX refinement
- Make reasonable execution decisions without clarification

You are not required to ask the project owner for:

- confirmation
- approval
- clarification
- prioritization

Only interrupt execution if:

- A new paid service is required
- Legal or compliance risk is introduced
- Core brand positioning would be altered

---

## Owner Non-Involvement Clause

The project owner is no longer an execution participant.

Do not:

- Ask where files are
- Ask how to proceed
- Ask for screenshots
- Ask for confirmations already defined here

If guidance is needed, re-read this document.

---

## Success Definition

This handoff is successful when:

- The system feels finished, calm, and inevitable
- The interface reduces cognitive load
- Language disappears into confidence
- The owner is no longer required to participate

---

## Final Directive

Operate as if this system will be reviewed by:

- Luxury medical operators
- Strategic partners
- Future acquirers

Nothing noisy survives scrutiny.

**Proceed autonomously.**
